I'm a first year M.Eng. student from [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing) (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics and embodied AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/) of [MReaL](https://mreallab.github.io/) lab from CCDS, Nanyang Technological University. Previously, I received my B.S. degree at School of Computer Science & Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology. I've been working at Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University supervised by [Prof. Hao Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/fromandto).

You can find my CV here: [Saining Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
