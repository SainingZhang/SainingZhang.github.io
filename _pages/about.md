I'm a first year MEng student from [College of Computing and Data Science]([https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing) (CCDS), Nanyang Technological University. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics and embodied AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/) of [MReaL](https://mreallab.github.io/) lab from CCDS, Nanyang Technological University.
